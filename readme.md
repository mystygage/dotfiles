# Dotfiles

dotfiles for OSX / Ubuntu


## Under Construction
I like the idea of putting dotfiles under version control and these are my first steps. Many scripts and configs are inspired and copied from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

## Usage

Clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/mystygage/dotfiles.git`
and execute bootstrap.sh
